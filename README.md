# Client-Startup-Checklist
Checklist for new clients to cross off as they get setup on Breeze. They are able to add their own items. 

WIth AngularJS the tool is able to cross off the list items from the object at the same time with Data Binding. THey can add and update the data/items stored in the object as well.

The tool was created and ran on Plunker (plnkr.co) using their AngularJS template.
